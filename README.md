# mycobol extending vscode_cobol

This is an example extension that extends the [vscode cobol extension](https://github.com/spgennard/vscode_cobol) in order provide some custom syntax for:

- ```$IF TOTEMX DEFINED```
- ```$IF XLSCX DEFINED```
- ```$END```

and a comment line that starts with ```| ```

For example:

You may use it as a start to create your own one, for example to add syntax-support for an own COBOL preparser you use.
